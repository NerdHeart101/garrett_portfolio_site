I am a technical communications and computer science student with a passion for writing, STEM/STEAM, instructional development, mobile application development, and immersive content!

I started work as a student technician for Lubbock-Cooper ISD, going all the way up to being a mobile device management technician where I made my biggest contributions to the department!

Notable tasks I did include:
- Helping plan, develop, and execute Lubbock-Cooper ISD's first 1:1 iPadOS/iOS deployment.
- Kickstarting our new tvOS and macOS deployments. 
- Planning and redoing the department's JAMF infrastructure, to make it more efficient and easier to maintain.
- Using my programming skills and JAMF advanced features to create improved and automate workflows for our deployments.

After five years of working for IT, I decided I wanted to focus on my college education and explore opportunities to be involved in education itself after my positive experiences as a volunteer and mentor for FIRST, BEST, and GEAR. I started volunteering and mentoring in 2018, with my first major project being helping kickstart the robotics program at Lubbock-Cooper Laura Bush Middle School and help founding the Jolly Roger and Black Pearl FTC robotics teams.

Other notable tasks I did include:
- Help kickstart the robotics program at Lubbock-Cooper East Elementary
- Teach students on the RoboRaiders FRC team how to program and add to the social media and public relations aspects.
- Act as a technical and control system advisor to FTC teams in West Texas.
- Support other FTC teams in our area such as All Saints and Talkington.

Shortly after leaving Lubbock-Cooper, I was offered to work as a assistant for the STEAM outreach program at Texas Tech! So far I have helped advanced the program in numerous ways, such as:
- Improving our communications with better emails, adding newsletters, and social media groups.
_ Create better marketing and promotional materials to get our programs out there.
- Learning new technologies that will benefit the program.
- Create training materials for our volunteers and teachers to help support them on their robotics journeys.

I plan to keep creating ways to improve the STEAM outreach program at Texas Tech and support more and more teachers in West Texas so they get the resources and help they need to run a successful robotics program for their school/organization!
